# This script creates a simple web application using Streamlit to demonstrate
# semantic matching between a resume and a job description. It uses a
# pre-trained Sentence-BERT model from the Hugging Face library to generate
# embeddings and calculate a contextual similarity score.
#
# To Run:
# 1. Make sure you have the required libraries installed:
#    pip install streamlit sentence-transformers torch
# 2. Save this code as 'app.py'.
# 3. Open a terminal in the same directory and run the command:
#    streamlit run app.py
